            <h1 className="skills--section--heading">Summary</h1>
            <p id="summaryText" className="text-lg">Coming from a strong background as an Executive for various job roles, I am now looking to re-establish myself as a developer. 
                                                    Programming is an area that I have always been interested in and I am now taking the opportunity to explore it as a serious career. 
                                                    To facilitate this change, I recently graduated from a coding Traineeship as a full stack developer including completing 2 real-world projects successfully to specification using a wide range of programming languages. 
                                                    Throughout my career to date, I have gained excellent communication, organisation and interpersonal skills, which I hope to apply alongside my technical skills in a new and challenging role in development. 
                                                    I am eager to gain commercial experience in the industry as I see myself working as a developer for the long term.</p>
